# Component: Button
[Online documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-iot-solution/en/latest/input_device/button.html)

After creating a new button object by calling function `button_create()`, the button object can create press events, every press event can have its own callback.

List of supported events:
 * Button pressed
 * Button released
 * Button pressed repeat
 * Button press repeat done
 * Button single click
 * Button double click
 * Button long press start
 * Button long press hold

There are three ways this driver can handle buttons:
1. Buttons connected to standard digital GPIO
2. Multiple buttons connected to single ADC channel
3. Custom button connect to any driver
